		<h1>Accumulate</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The accumulate panel lets you perform the actual accumulation and review the results.
		</p>
		<h2>Master dataset</h2>
		<p>
			Every dataset loaded has a label (although not necessarily a unique one, as they get recognised internally not by their label, so you are free to use whatever label suits best your needs). As accumulation creates a new dataset, you can (and should) specify a label for it here.
		</p>
		<h2>Label for new dataset</h2>
		<p>
			Every dataset loaded has a label (although not necessarily a unique one, as they get recognised internally not by their label, so you are free to use whatever label suits best your needs). As accumulation creates a new dataset, you can (and should) specify a label for it here.
		</p>
		<h2>Dimensions (accumulated)</h2>
		<p>
			In terms of its controls identical to the subpanel of the datasets panel, the dimensions subpanel gives you an easy overview over the dimensions of the accumulated (i.e. newly created) dataset. 
		</p>
		<h2>Slider position</h2>
		<p>
			Given that you loaded a 2D dataset and are currently displaying a 1D representation along one of the two axes, you can set and get the axis positions along x and y here, both as index and unit (if available).
