		<h1>Bugs and Limitations</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			As the ASCII Importer GUI has been developed due to an actual need, there are a number of known bugs and limitations that will be described below.
		</p>
		<h2>Missing features</h2>
		<p>
			The template feature does not work yet. This holds true for both, the template selector at the top of the settings panel and the save functionality at its bottom.
		</p>
		<h2>1D datasets not tested</h2>
		<p>
			The GUI has not yet been tested thoroughly with 1D datasets.
		</p>
		<h2>No input validation</h2>
		<p>
			Currently, the edit fields are <em>not validated</em> at all. Therefore, the user might easily break the GUI and/or the following import process by entering wrong or not sensible values.
