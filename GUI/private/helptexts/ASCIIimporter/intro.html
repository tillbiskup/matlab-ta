		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A rather short introduction to the ASCII Importer GUI.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Suppose you have some ASCII data that you would like to import into the TA GUI. Preview your data using the <key>...</key> button in the "Filename" panel on the top and make your way through the "Settings" panel while checking in the "File display" panel for the necessary parameters. Finally press <key>Import</key> on the bottom right, and if everything goes well, you'll have your data imported into the TA GUI afterwards.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>To the gentle reader</h2>
		<p>
			The ASCII Importer GUI emerged from the need to import nearly arbitrary ASCII data into the TA GUI. That allows to display data from many different sources, as long as they are available as ASCII data, nearly regardless how these files look like.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is to preview an ASCII file in the left "File display" panel and using that information set all the necessary parameters in the <a href="settings.html">Settings panel</a> on the right.
		</p>
		<h3>GUI layout</h3>
		<p>
			The ASCII Importer GUI window should be fairly intuitive and simple to use. It is divided basically into two parts: the file selection and preview part on the left and the settings for the import in the <a href="settings.html">Settings panel</a> on the right.
		</p>
		<p>
			More details regarding the settings be found in the respective help topic: <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a number of <a href="bugs.html">known bugs and limitations</a> of this GUI that might be of importance.
		</p>
		<p>
			BTW: The button with the questionmark shows this help, as you might have figured out already.
		</p>
		<h3>Normal operation</h3>
		<p>
			The import process starts with selecting a file to import (and preview) by pressing the <key>...</key> button in the "Filename" panel on the top. After having selected a file, a preview of this (ASCII) file will be displayed in the "File display" panel below. (Please note that it might take up to a few seconds to display the file and that the file preview may be truncated to speed up).
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you have a preview of your file and can make your way through the <a href="settings.html">Settings panel</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you have made all necessary settings, simply click on the <key>Import</key> button in the bottom right to import your data and append them to the TA GUI. If everything worked well, you shall now have you data displayed in the TA GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you decide to abort the import process, simply hit <key>Esc</key> or click on the <key>Cancel</key> button. This will close the ASCII Importer GUI window.
		</p>
		<p>
			To close the Figure Caption GUI, simply hit the <key>Import</key> or <key>Cancel</key> buttons on the bottom right, depening on whether you want to import your data or discard the whole process. This will bring you back to the main GUI. Alternatively, you may press <key>Esc</key> or <key>Ctrl+w</key>, both cancelling the import.
