DISPLAY

The display panel lets you choose for which of the datasets currently loaded in the main GUI the MFE should be calculated for, set the display type and the slider parameters.


Datasets

When opening the MFE GUI, all datasets that were set to "visible" in the main GUI show up in the list of datasets. Here, you can choose the dataset you want to perform the MFE for.


Display type

The display type popupmenu is the well-known control element from the main GUI that allows you to switch between 2D and 1D representations.


MFE Display type

The MFE display type popupmenu is the control element known from the MFE panel of the main GUI that allows you to switch between the different MFE display modes.


Slider position

Given that you loaded a 2D dataset and are currently displaying a 1D representation along one of the two axes, you can set and get the axis positions along x and y here, both as index and unit (if available).

The checkbox "Show position in main display" toggles between the display of red lines for the position in x and y in the main (upper) display of the MFE GUI.

With "Set to maximum" you can conveniently set the position both in x and y to the maximum of the dataset.


Measure

To measure a point in the currently displayed dataset, press the "Pick" button and move the pointer to inside the main axes. The x and y values in the "Measure" panel will display the current pointer position in coordinates of the currently displayed dataset.

To measure a certain point, simply click. That will leave the measure mode and show the measured point permanently in the "Measure" panel.

To leave the measure mode, you can click on the "Pick" button once again.

To clear a measurement, press the "Clear" button in the "Measure" panel.
