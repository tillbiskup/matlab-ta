INTRODUCTION

A rather short introduction to the MFE GUI


-=IF IN A HURRY=-

Select the dataset you want to calculate the MFE for in the "Visible datasets" listbox in the "Display" panel, ...


-=TO THE GENTLE READER=-

The Magnetic Field Effect (MFE) GUI is dedicated to the task of calculating the magnetic field effect of spectra. ...


GUI layout

Basically, the MFE GUI window is divided into three panels that are all located to the right. You can switch between them with the buttons on the top or via shortcuts Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-3.

More details to all the different panels and the meaning of their control elements can be found in the respective help topic.


Normal operation

Normally, you simply go through the panels, first deciding about which dataset to average, set the axes to a reasonable point that allows you to observe in the lower, auxilliary axes the area you are averaging over (the easiest way to achieve that might be to press the "Maximum" button in the "Slider position" panel in the "Display" panel), then switch to the "Magnetic Field Effect" panel, set the area to average over, and finally hit the "Magnetic Field Effect" button.

After you did that, you will see the result in the main axis, where you can inspect it in the ususal way, and compare it to the full (original) dataset.

If happy with the results, press the "Apply" button, perform the same tasks with any other dataset, and in the end, simply "Close" the GUI and your data will be written to the main GUI as new datasets. If unhappy, hit "Discard" and either start a new round with different parameters or "Close" the GUI without writing back anything to the main GUI.


BTW: The button with the questionmark shows this help, as you might have figured out already.
