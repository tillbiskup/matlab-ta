SETTINGS

The settings panel lets you make a few settings regarding the appearance of the MFE GUI.


Grid

Whether or not to display a grid can be set with the controls of this panel. Default is to display a zero line (as a dashed line), but no grid.


Average area

To change the way the averaged area is displayed both in the auxilliary and main axes (the latter depending on the current display mode), you can change both colour and transparency ("Alpha", meaning the alpha value that defines the transparency) of the area.


Line settings

To change the way the different traces are displayed in the main axes, you can change here both colour and line settings, the latter being style, marker, and width.


Smoothing

These are the settings for the smoothed version of the "DeltaMF" trace. Its line settings can be set via the "Line settings" subpanel described above.


Defaults

Pressing this button will reset all settings to the default values.
