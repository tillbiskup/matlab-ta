This toolbox and especially the GUI would not have been possible without many people contributing by some means or other.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A very special thanks for their outstanding support and encouragement goes to:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
They are to a big deal responsible for my understanding of what science is all about, and how to be a good scientist, and I'm deeply indebted to both of them that they convinced me that science is the place to be.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Many thanks for all the years we spent together
(not only) in science!

Many other people contributed ideas,
helped with tips&tricks, patiently debugged.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To name only the most important ones.

He voluteered readily to test the toolbox in all stages, patiently answered all my sometimes stupid or even silly questions, motivated me always to continue working on and improving the toolbox, and contributed many valuable ideas.

They taught me TA in the first place and therefore are responsible for me feeling the need to program a toolbox that can handle those data in a convenient and user-friendly way.

Besides his warm friendship, he always readily shared his encyclopedic knowledge of nearly everything with me.

<em>"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity."</em> There are many, many more important things to acknowledge him for than this toolbox. Nevertheless: He was the one who taught me programming in the first place, and I owe most of my knowledge about good programming practice to him. If there is any good concepts and ideas, it's due to him.

Others helped as well quite a lot, although rather anonymously. Parts of the code are based on code written by other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention it directly in the respective files.

Nevertheless, to mention the most important
