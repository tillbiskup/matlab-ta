This toolbox and especially the GUI
would not have been possible without many people
contributing by some means or other.


A very special thanks
for their outstanding support and encouragement
goes to:


Stefan Weber
&
Erik Schleicher


They are to a big deal responsible for my understanding of what science is all about, and how to be a good scientist, and I'm deeply indebted to both of them that they convinced me that science is the place to be.

Many thanks for all the years we spent together
(not only) in science!

Many other people contributed ideas,
helped with tips&tricks, patiently debugged.

To name only the most important ones.


Bernd Paulus

He voluteered readily to test the toolbox in all stages, patiently answered all my sometimes stupid or even silly questions, motivated me always to continue working on and improving the toolbox, and contributed many valuable ideas.


Kevin Henbest & Kiminori Maeda

They taught me TA in the first place and therefore are responsible for me feeling the need to program a toolbox that can handle those data in a convenient and user-friendly way.


Martin Hussels

Besides his warm friendship, he always readily shared his encyclopedic knowledge of nearly everything with me.


Rudolf Kaal

"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity." There are many, many more important things to acknowledge him for than this toolbox. Nevertheless: He was the one who taught me programming in the first place, and I owe most of my knowledge about good programming practice to him. If there is any good concepts and ideas, it's due to him.

Apologies for the incompleteness of this list.

Who thinks that he or she is missing on the list,
feel free to send me an email.

Others helped as well quite a lot, although rather anonymously. Parts of the code are based on code written by other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention it directly in the respective files.

Nevertheless, to mention the most important
sources of inspiration:


The Matlab(TM) documentation and examples

All the guys at Matlab Central & FileExchange

A big "THANK YOU" to all users.

























And finally, a word of wisdom
for all programmers of software:


"If you make something idiotproof,
someone'll build a better idiot!"
