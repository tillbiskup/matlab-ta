		<h1>Why writing a GUI?</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A rather lenghtly answer to a simple question.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inspired by the trEPR toolbox and all the experience with writing a GUI there, it was an obvious step to do the same for transient absorption (TA, sometimes termed flash photolysis) optical data. And here, from the very beginning on, the idea was to make everything much more consistent by design.
		</p>
		<p>
			Especially given that some of the data recorded were not easy to assemble to a 2D dataset and needed much manual work, a GUI helping with that process seemed reasonable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to constant encouragement and support from a good friend and colleague (for details see "Help:About" - press the "About" button above or the "F1" key and wait a bit) the development of the GUI continued beyond initial stages that contained, while usable with some data, multitudinous bugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			The current version of the GUI is based completely on the GUI of the trEPR toolbox, and the concept of having both modularity and stability in mind from the very beginning payed off already quite a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basically, the same principal design goals apply for both GUIs: a reduction in size so that it fits even to such small monitors as that of the smallest MacBook Pro with a resolution of only 1280x800 px.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final aim of the GUI is to provide the user with an easy-to-use and robust interface for the daily data processing and data analysis of TA data. Key concepts are the import of a variety of data formats and export capabilities both of figures and data for further processing with other, more specialised, types of software (including, but not restricted to, MATLAB(TM)).
