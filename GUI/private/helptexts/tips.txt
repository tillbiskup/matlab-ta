The TA Toolbox consists of nearly <strong>50.000 lines</strong> of code (&gt;40.000 for the GUI) in 90 files (<em>v.0.0.8</em>).

The new <strong>Fit GUI</strong> allows you to fit nearly arbitrary functions to  1D traces of your datasets.

You can <strong>close this window</strong> by hiting "Esc" or "Ctrl-w", or with the "Close" button.

You can <strong>close every window</strong> of the TA Toolbox GUI by hitting "Ctrl-w".

The new <strong>toolbox file format</strong> saves the data as binary (32-bit float) to save memory and speed up loading.

Double-click on a dataset in the dataset listbox lets you <strong>change its label</strong>. Try it out!

The topic &quot;<strong>New features</strong>&quot; in the TA Toolbox Help window lists the new features of every version.

Nearly every GUI window can now be <strong>configured</strong>, easiest using the "Configure panel" of the Main GUI.

The GUI comes with extensive <strong>built-in help</strong>. You can access it by either hitting "F1" or pressing the button with the blue question mark.

The help usually contains a section "<strong>If in a hurry</strong>" for the busy users.

<strong>Power users</strong> may set "<tt>welcome = 0</tt>" in the Main GUI configuration file for a faster start.

You can scroll with the <strong>arrow keys</strong>, &larr; and &rarr;, of your <em>keyboard</em> through these tips.

You can <strong>display a legend</strong>, and even move it around with the mouse. But beware: It may slightly change position during export.

You can use <strong>TeX strings</strong> in axis labels, such as <tt>\Delta</tt>, to display Greek characters. 

The <strong>labels</strong> of your datasets get used in the figure legend. Use that for proper figure legends.
